Improved, binary-incompatible edition of nopCPU.
It is licensed under the LGPL license. For more information, read the COPYING
file.
(One exception is the testbench, which is licensed under the ISC license.)

(This is a WIP!)

New features include:
  -A stack!
  -A modified, more flexible (IMO) ISA!
  -16-bit address space! [TODO]
